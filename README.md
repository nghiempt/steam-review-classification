Official code implementation for ICDE 9999 paper Deciphering Sentiments in the Gaming Sphere: Machine Learning Approaches to Predicting Steam Review Recommendations.

> This paper identifies. In this research, we embarked on a comprehensive journey through the intricacies of text classification in the Steam reviews. Our methodology, outlined in Chapter III, meticulously navigated the key stages of data collection, cleaning, vectorization, model training, optimization, and evaluation. The heart of our exploration lies in the comparison and analysis of two potent classification algorithms: Naive Baye, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ...

## Abstract

In the area of online product critiques, distinguishing between endorsed and no longer endorsed critiques is vital for knowledgeable choice-making. This paper gives a conventional gadget getting-to-know-primarily based technique for binary detection of overview guidelines on the Steam platform. Leveraging a dataset of classified critiques, we appoint characteristic engineering and a number of conventional gadget-getting-to-know algorithms, which include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Naive Bayes, to construct a sturdy advice classifier. We compare the model's overall performance the use of fashionable metrics and discover the effect of various characteristic units and algorithms on class accuracy. Our outcomes display the effectiveness of conventional gadget-getting-to-know strategies in mechanically categorizing Steam critiques as endorsed or no longer endorsed. This study contributes to improving a person's enjoyment and helping purchasers in making extra knowledgeable alternatives while navigating the extensive global of virtual recreation critiques.
